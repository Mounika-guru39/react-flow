# Dynamic Diagram Flow (React + React Flow)

## Overview
This is a starter React application that uses **React Flow** to render an interactive diagram driven by JSON metadata. 
You can add nodes, connect them with edges, edit node labels, delete selected items, and persist state to `localStorage`.

## Quick start
1. Ensure Node.js >= 16 and npm are installed.
2. In the project root run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. The app will open at http://localhost:3000

## Project structure
- `src/` - source code
- `public/` - static HTML
- `src/metadata.json` - sample metadata to load initial nodes & edges

## Notes
- This was packaged for you as a zip. Extract and run `npm install` before `npm start`.
- If your React Flow version differs, consult https://reactflow.dev for API docs.
